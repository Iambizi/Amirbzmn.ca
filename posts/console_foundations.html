					<h3><a href="#">The Console</a> <time class="post-date text-muted">July 7th 2017</time></h3>
					<p class="post text-left">For my 1st post i decided to talk about what i've learned about the console, and why it's an important skill for any one learning to code. The console is just another way to interact with your computer.<br>
					I have to admit it seemed pretty intimidating at first as I reviewed all the different courses on my <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/amirbizimana">treehouse</a> track, but it's actually not as scary as it looks.<br>
					I'll be focusing on the the Mac OS X command line.<br>
					First Let's get a few terms defined:</p><br>
					<ul class="text-left post">
						<li><strong class="text-primary">The console</strong> : This is the system as a whole. This is both the command line as well as the output from previous commands.</li>
						<li><strong class="text-primary">Command line</strong> : The space to the right of the command prompt in which a user enters commands and data. It provides a means of communication between a user and a computer that is based solely on textual input and output. The command line provides you the ability to interact with your computer using text commands, often making actions that would be difficult with menus or mouse clicks simple.</li>
						<li><strong class="text-primary">Prompt</strong> : This is the beginning of the command line. It usually provides some contextual information like the user, your current directory (where you are) and other useful info. It typically ends in a <span class="text-primary">$</span> . After the prompt is where you will be typing commands.</li>
						<li><strong class="text-primary">Directory</strong> : You can think of this as an other term for folder, it's what we used to call folders when we didn't have graphical interfaces with desktops, menus, and windows.  </li>
						<li><strong class="text-primary">Terminal</strong> : This is the actual interface to the console. The program we use to interact with the console is actually a “terminal emulator”, providing us the experience of typing into an old school terminal from the convenience of our modern graphical operating system.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="text-left post">In the console instead of working with windows, menus, toolbars and buttons, you are just interacting with text. You perform actions by writing commands, and you get your information back from the computer in the form of text.<br>
					<span class="text-primary">Why would we ever want to do this?</span>::emoji::<br>
					Even though it seems complex and difficult to use a text-only interfaced computer, it's actually quite liberating. That's because when you use the console, there's much more flexibility and consistency than when you're using a graphical user interface.  Programs can be linked together to perform really powerful actions  that would be impossible to create using simple menus and buttons.<br>
					<br>
					Also When you're programming or doing web development or design, some of the tools you may use may not have a graphical interface. These tools must run on the console. And if you're not familiar with the console, it will be a very frustrating experience. </p>
					<h3 class="lead text-muted">Running a command</h3><br>
					<p class="post text-left">A command is usually composed of 3 parts: The program, the option on that program and the argument.<br>
					Example: <span class="text-primary">$ ls -l ~</span><br>
					<span class="text-primary">ls</span> <span class="text-primary">-l</span> <span class="text-primary">~</span></p>
					<h3 class="lead text-muted">Moving around in the console</h3><br>
